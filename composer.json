To use the API, you need a client ID and secret from the Vouchsafe dashboard. [Sign up here](https://app.vouchsafe.id/) if you haven't already.  We also have a [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx6V6SSTMuF_ZNWBPnysvwmdIwboLViE8) showing the basics, as well as [SDKs and libraries](https://help.vouchsafe.id/en/articles/12026847-vouchsafe-sdks-and-libraries) for popular languages.",
